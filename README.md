# Mention Extractor

A Python tool that searches for specific words or phrases in video subtitle files (.srt) and creates a compilation video of all mentions using ffmpeg with **precise audio-based timing**.

## Features

### üî• **NEW: Precision Audio Analysis**
- **Multiple Phrase Search**: Enter multiple phrases (e.g., "Trump", "President Trump")
- **TTS-Based Timing**: Uses local text-to-speech to generate reference audio
- **Audio Cross-Correlation**: Finds exact timing of phrases within subtitle segments
- **Quarter-Second Precision**: Clips are trimmed to 0.25s before + phrase + 0.25s after
- **Smart Counter**: Accurately counts multiple mentions within single subtitle fragments

### üé¨ **Core Features**
- Searches through all .srt subtitle files in `videos/` folder
- Finds every mention of user-specified phrases (case-insensitive)
- Extracts ultra-precise video clips using audio analysis
- Adds visual counter overlay with drop shadow (e.g., "Trump Counter: 15")
- Plays ding sound effect before each phrase (requires `audio/ding.mp3`)
- Creates tight compilation videos with no wasted time
- Supports multiple video formats (.mp4, .avi, .mkv, .mov, .wmv)

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- ffmpeg installed and available in PATH
- Required Python packages (see Installation)

```

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

## Usage

1. **Setup folder structure:**
   - Create a `videos/` folder
   - Place your video files (.mp4, .avi, etc.) and subtitle files (.srt) in the `videos/` folder
   - Optionally add `audio/ding.mp3` for sound effects

2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   python mention_extractor.py
   ```

3. **Enter your search phrases:**
   - Input multiple phrases (one per line)
   - Press Enter twice when done
   - Example: "Trump", "President Trump", "Donald"

4. **Watch the magic happen:**
   - TTS audio generation for phrase matching
   - Audio analysis to find exact phrase timing
   - Ultra-precise clip extraction (0.25s padding)
   - Compilation video creation: `compilation_[phrases]_[timestamp].mp4`

## Example

```

## File Structure

The program expects your files to be organized like this:
```
your_directory/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mention_extractor.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ install_requirements.bat  # Windows installer
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ audio/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ding.mp3             # Optional: sound effect for each mention
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fonts/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CoolveticaRg.otf     # Font for counter overlay
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ videos/                  # All videos and subtitles go here
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ video1.mp4
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ video1.en.srt
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ video2.mp4
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ video2.en.srt
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

The subtitle files should have the same base name as their corresponding video files. The `audio/ding.mp3` file is optional but recommended for the full experience.

## Technical Details

### üî¨ **Audio Analysis Pipeline**
- **TTS Generation**: Uses `pyttsx3` to generate reference audio for each search phrase
- **Audio Extraction**: FFmpeg extracts 16kHz mono audio from video segments  
- **Cross-Correlation**: `scipy.signal.correlate` finds exact phrase timing within segments
- **Precision Timing**: Clips trimmed to 0.25s before phrase + phrase duration + 0.25s after

### üé¨ **Video Processing**
- **Search**: Case-insensitive substring matching with multiple phrase support
- **Overlap Removal**: Smart merging of overlapping subtitle segments
- **Counter Logic**: Accurate counting of multiple mentions within single fragments
- **Visual Overlay**: White text with drop shadow in top-right corner (e.g., "Trump Counter: 15")
- **Audio Mixing**: Ding sound mixed with original audio before each phrase
- **Fallback Mode**: If TTS fails, falls back to subtitle-based timing

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Output Specifications**
- **Format**: MP4 with H.264/AAC encoding
- **Video**: 30fps, original resolution, CRF 23 quality
- **Audio**: 48kHz stereo, perfect sync with video
- **Cleanup**: All temporary files automatically deleted after processing

## Troubleshooting

- **"ffmpeg is not installed"**: Make sure ffmpeg is installed and in your system PATH
- **"No video file found"**: Ensure video files have the same base name as .srt files
- **"No SRT files found"**: Make sure subtitle files are in the same directory as the script
- **Extraction errors**: Check that video files aren't corrupted and timestamps are valid

## Notes

- The program re-encodes all clips to ensure perfect audio/video synchronization and prevent corruption
- Processing time is longer due to re-encoding, but results in much higher quality output
- All clips are standardized to 30fps and 48kHz stereo audio for consistency
- Large numbers of matches will take longer to process due to re-encoding
- The output filename includes a timestamp to avoid overwriting previous compilations
